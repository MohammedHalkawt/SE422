Couldnt take notes until: 8:37...

The linked list is never going to get full, and even if we have 4 threads from the threadPool, it will never become more than 4, since the linked list doesnt get full, we can add a limit for the linked list?

We use a linkedBlockingQueue because if our queue holds 6 tasks for example, and we have set 6 as the limit for its capacity, the linkedblockingqueue will put the application that has called the executorService to sleep so it doesnt push it over the limit, and then it will increase the thread from 4 to 5 until it reaches 10

since our logic is that it starts form 4 threads and it expands to 10, if its not limited then it doesnt allow for expansion, a new thread will be added to the threadpool only if the queue becomes full

ExecutorService executor = 
    new ThreadPoolExecutor (4,// the number of core threads
                            10,// max number of threads in the threadPool
                            60L,
                            TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                            new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(10)
                            
                            )

look in to the max_value one too
ExecutorService executor = 
    new ThreadPoolExecutor (0,// the number of core threads
                            Integer.MAX_VALUE,// max number of threads in the threadPool
                            60L,//timeout window between things?
                            TimeUnit.SECONDS,//still related to timeout i think
                            new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(10)
                            
                            )

we will now use a sunchronousQueue instead of a linkedBlockingQueue
ExecutorService executor = 
    new ThreadPoolExecutor (0,// the number of core threads
                            5,// max number of threads in the threadPool
                            60L,
                            TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                            new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>()//the size is zero always, so adding one task will always need a new thread, which means if we reach the limit which is 5 threads in the pool, then we want more, our application will be put to sleep

                            if we have very small computations, then using the SynchronousQueue and the Integer.MAX_VALUE will be good since instead of manually making the threads, they will be automatically created and can also be used again later.
                            
                            )

ExecutorService executor = 
    new ThreadPoolExecutor (0,
                            Integer.MAX_VALUE,
                            60L,
                            TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                            new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>(10)
                            ) this is the same as cachedThreadPool which is a ready method




ExecutorService:
Started at 9:26.
You are a submitter and the task submitters itself is a thread. When you are submitting a task, that task is being added to the task queue. Anything in task queue are runnable objects.
When one of these threads become free in the thread pool, it will pull the oldest runnable object from task queue. It will execute by calling the run method. When you call submit/execute, you add tasks to the test queue and once the pool is free, it will pull that task from the queue and execute the run method on it.

The problem with a fixed threadpool, the main problemm is that its fixed. So, if its full, it will remain full. In certain cases, this can cause a problem. How? If a thread is free, a task will be pulled from the queue and it will be given to the pool. The condition is that it MUST be free. That's where it can cause a problem. Thread busyness can be a problem in some casse.

A thread must be free means that when it is not busy and doing tasks on the pc. A thread is busy when it performs any runnable object. Maybe manually or with thread synchronizers. It has nothing to do with the cpu. Its about if you're going to have a thread runnable.

The only case a thread is free is when it has executed that run method and it has reached an end such as void run().



Based on certain conditions, we'll add threads or we wont. these custom thread pools are really good when we have synchronizors, deadlocks, etc..
